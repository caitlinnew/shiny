# Billing
Billing focuses on subscriptions and pay plans.

Nexio's subscription service allows you to run recurring transactions. These can be in the form of basic subscriptions or as pay plans.

Subscriptions set transactions to run for a specified amount on a predefined schedule.

Pay plans set recurring transactions to run until the pre-specified balance is paid in full.
