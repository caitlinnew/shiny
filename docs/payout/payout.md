# Payout
Payouts are push payments.

A payout is the request from the payer (merchant or business, for example) to fund a recipientâ€™s balance, wallet, or account.

A recipient is the individual or business receiving payments. Before paying out to a recipient, a recipient profile must first be created either as a separate step or simultaneously with the payout request.

A common recipient payout experience is logging into a payout provider portal and claiming funds. 

Nexio has integrated several payout providers while continuing to provide the same portal experience to recipients, including email notifications and a reporting interface.
