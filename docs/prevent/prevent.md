# Prevent
Prevent is about fraud management.

Nexio provides many features to help prevent against fraud.
- The Address Verifcation Service (AVS) compares the address and postal code provided with the information on file with the credit card issuer. Nexio interprets these results and returns them concisely back to you, making it easy for you to determine which cards to save, giving you greater control over your risk management.
- Device fingerprinting helps detect fraudulent behavior even when a user changes their IP address, device, account information or other identifying information.
- Nexio uses Kount for fraud and risk management. Contact your CMS sales agent for more information or if you are interested in using Kount with your Nexio merchant account.
- The Nexio security code verification feature (`verifyCvc`) allows you to save only those cards that pass a security code check, helping you reduce your risk of fraud.
