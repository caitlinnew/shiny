# Route
Route's focus is on intelligent payment routing.

Nexio allows you to customize the payment flow for consumer purchases. Previously, you could customize the payment flow only through assigning different currencies to each merchant account (MID), running transactions through different API users, using a specific MID, or specifying a specific tag for payment options on each MID.

You can now route transactions based on items in the transaction, monthly gross of authorized transactions (also known as transaction volume), or with an advanced payment routing flow.
